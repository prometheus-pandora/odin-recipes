        <p>Learn to make fluffy white rice!</p>
        <p>Makes 3 cups of rice.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup (200g) of white rice (medium or long grain)</li>
            <li>1.5 cups (375 mL) of water</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>(Optional) Rinse the rice under cold running water to remove excess starch, dirt and debris</li>
            <li>Place 1 cup (200g) of white rice and 1.5 cups (375 mL) of water into a large saucepan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once a gentle boil is reached, turn the heat down to low and cover with a lid. Let simmer untouched for 12-14 minutes.</li>
            <li>Keeping the lod on, tilt the saucepan to check if any unabsorbed water remains. If there is still loose water, let it cook for another 1-2 minutes and check again.</li>
            <li>Once all of the water has been absorbed, remove the rice from the heat and let rest with the lid on for 10 minutes.</li>
